### Summary

Guidance information for the FHIR STU3 Core Specification. 

### **Important** ###

This Core specification is in the **Discovery** stage based on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery" target="_blank">GDS agile delivery</a>. It is an initial Core specification for review, research and engagement only. 

It is also intended to demonstrate a proposed approach to generating a UK Core specification, using the <a href="https://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=IG_Publisher_Documentation" target="_blank">HL7 IG Publisher tool</a>.

The approach documented here is currently being evaluated and discussed with parties who are actively involved NHS Digital programmes, such as maternity.

- This specification MUST not be shared outside of NHS Digital.
- This specification has been created using FHIR STU3, which is not the version to be used for any UK Core specification for implementation.
- The UK Core specification using R4 will be released at a later date, once the approach to core specification has been agreed and signed off by NHS Digital and NHSX. 

Nothing contained in this Core specification should be implemented or proposed as a solution to vendors. 

### FHIR Profiles - Minimum Viable Content

For a set of generic profiles to be usable across many use cases, there is a need for rules around what is the minimum amount of information a profile must contain to make it clinically useful and safe. 

At present, the mandatory elements for the FHIR profiles in this specification will inform the current minimum viable content and examples. 

Additional content will be identified following technical and clinical review of this baseline specification.
