### Summary

Guidance information for the FHIR STU3 Core Specification. 

### Introduction

This specification contains the FHIR assets from the [HL7 FHIR Reference Server](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/) and is intended to provide a baseline specification to be circulated for feedback. 

Future work will include:

- resolution of validation and quality errors
- changes following feedback received
- changes following [issues reported on the FHIR-STU3-Core-IG-1.0.0 GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhsconnect/FHIR-STU3-Core-IG-1.0.0/issues).

### Project Life Cycle

This specification will be based on [GDS agile delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery), and is currently in the **discovery** phase.

### FHIR Profiles - Minimum Viable Content

For a set of generic profiles to be usable across many use cases, there is a need for rules around what is the minimum amount of information a profile must contain to make it clinically useful and safe. 

At present, the mandatory elements for the FHIR profiles in this specification will inform the current minimum viable content and examples. 

Additional content will be identified following technical and clinical review of this baseline specification.
